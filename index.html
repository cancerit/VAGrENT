<p>Variation Annotation GENeraTor</p>

<p>A suite of perl modules that compares genomic variations with reference genome annotations
and generates the possible effects each variant may have on the transcripts it overlaps. It evaluates
each variation/transcript combination and describes the effects in the mRNA, CDS and protein sequence
contexts. It provides details of the sequence and position of the change within the transcript/protein
as well as Sequence Ontology terms to classify its consequences.</p>

<hr><h3>
<a name="dependenciesinstall" class="anchor" href="#dependenciesinstall"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies/Install</h3>

<p>Some of the code included in this package has dependencies on several C packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/samtools/samtools">Samtools</a> - max 0.1.20 until perl bindings are updated</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/samtools/samtools/tabix">tabix</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/">vcftools</a></li>
</ul><p>And various perl modules.</p>

<p>Please use <code>setup.sh</code> to install the dependencies.  Please be aware that this expects basic C
compilation libraries and tools to be available, most are listed in <code>INSTALL</code>.</p>
