{"name":"VAGrENT","tagline":"A toolset for comparing genomic variants to reference genome annotation to identify potential biological consequences","body":"VAGrENT\r\n======\r\n\r\nVariation Annotation GENeraTor\r\n\r\nA suite of perl modules that compares genomic variations with reference genome annotations\r\nand generates the possible effects each variant may have on the transcripts it overlaps. It evaluates\r\neach variation/transcript combination and describes the effects in the mRNA, CDS and protein sequence\r\ncontexts. It provides details of the sequence and position of the change within the transcript/protein\r\nas well as Sequence Ontology terms to classify its consequences.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n###Dependencies/Install\r\nSome of the code included in this package has dependencies on several C packages:\r\n\r\n * [Samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools) - max 0.1.20 until perl bindings are updated\r\n * [tabix](https://github.com/samtools/samtools/tabix)\r\n * [vcftools](http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/)\r\n\r\nAnd various perl modules.\r\n\r\nPlease use `setup.sh` to install the dependencies.  Please be aware that this expects basic C\r\ncompilation libraries and tools to be available, most are listed in `INSTALL`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLICENCE\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Genome Research Ltd.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Cancer Genome Project <cgpit@sanger.ac.uk>\r\n\r\nThis file is part of VAGrENT.\r\n\r\nVAGrENT is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\r\nthe terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any\r\nlater version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\r\nANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS\r\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
